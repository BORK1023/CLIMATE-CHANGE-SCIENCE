	<h1>Climate Change: Effects and Importance</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with far-reaching consequences for our planet and its inhabitants. According to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" class="link">IPCC</a>, climate change is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.</p>
	<h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
	<p>Climate change has severe effects on the environment, human health, and the economy. Some of the effects include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rising sea levels and coastal flooding</li>
		<li>Increased frequency and severity of heatwaves, droughts, and storms</li>
		<li>Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem disruption</li>
		<li>Negative impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human settlements</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Importance of Climate Change</h2>
	<p>It is essential to address climate change because of its significant impacts on human societies and the environment. According to <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/" class="link">UN</a>, climate change can have devastating effects on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Human health and well-being</li>
		<li>Food security and sustainable agriculture</li>
		<li>Water resources and sanitation</li>
		<li>Economic growth and sustainable development</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Real-Life Applications of Angle of Depression and Angle Elevation</h2>
	<p>Angles of depression and elevation are crucial in understanding climate change. For instance:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Measuring sea level rise: Angles of depression can be used to measure the rate of sea level rise.</li>
		<li>Tracking glacier melting: Angles of elevation can be used to track the rate of glacier melting.</li>
	</ul>
