<h1>Climate Change: Effects and Importance</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, with far-reaching consequences for our planet and its inhabitants. According to <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" class="link">IPCC</a>, climate change is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane.</p>
	<h2>Effects of Climate Change</h2>
	<p>Climate change has severe effects on the environment, human health, and the economy. Some of the effects include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Rising sea levels and coastal flooding</li>
		<li>Increased frequency and severity of heatwaves, droughts, and storms</li>
		<li>Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem disruption</li>
		<li>Negative impacts on agriculture, water resources, and human settlements</li>

	</ul>
	<h2>Importance of Climate Change</h2>
	<p>It is essential to address climate change because of its significant impacts on human societies and the environment. According to <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/" class="link">UN</a>, climate change can have devastating effects on:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Human health and well-being</li>
		<li>Food security and sustainable agriculture</li>
		<li>Water resources and sanitation</li>
		<li>Economic growth and sustainable development</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Real-Life Applications of Angle of Depression and Angle Elevation</h2>
	<p>Angles of depression and elevation are crucial in understanding climate change. For instance:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Measuring sea level rise: Angles of depression can be used to measure the rate of sea level rise.</li>
		<li>Tracking glacier melting: Angles of elevation can be used to track the rate of glacier melting.</li>

<h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
	<p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, weather patterns, and atmospheric conditions on Earth. While natural factors (such as volcanic eruptions and solar cycles) can influence climate, human activities—especially burning fossil fuels—are the main drivers of recent changes. <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/" class="link">Learn more</a></p>
	
	<h2>Causes of Climate Change - Armas </h2>
	<p>1. Greenhouse Gas Emissions – Carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O) trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.</p>
	<p>2. Deforestation – Cutting down forests reduces the number of trees that absorb CO₂.</p>
	<p>3. Industrial and Agricultural Activities – Factories, transportation, and farming (e.g., livestock releasing methane) contribute significantly.</p>
	<p>4. Fossil Fuel Use – Burning coal, oil, and gas releases CO₂ into the air.</p>
	
	<h2>Effects of Climate Change - Llaneras</h2>
	<p>Rising Temperatures – Global temperatures have increased by about 1.2°C (2.2°F) since the late 1800s.</p>
	<p>Extreme Weather – More frequent and intense hurricanes, heat waves, wildfires, and droughts.</p>
	<p>Melting Ice Caps and Rising Sea Levels – Polar ice is melting, causing sea levels to rise and threatening coastal cities.</p>
	<p>Threats to Wildlife – Many species struggle to adapt to changing habitats, leading to extinction risks.</p>
	<p>Food and Water Shortages – Droughts and extreme weather impact agriculture and water supply.</p>
	
	<h2>Possible Solutions</h2>
	<p>1. Renewable Energy – Using solar, wind, and hydroelectric power instead of fossil fuels.</p>
	<p>2. Reforestation and Conservation – Planting trees and protecting forests to absorb CO₂.</p>
	<p>3. Energy Efficiency – Using less electricity and switching to sustainable transportation (like electric cars).</p>
	<p>4. Climate Policies – Governments enforcing regulations to reduce emissions and invest in green technology.</p>
	<p>5. Public Awareness & Lifestyle Changes – Reducing waste, eating sustainable foods, and supporting eco-friendly products.</p>
